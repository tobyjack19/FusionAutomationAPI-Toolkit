// Minimal runtime shim for @adsk/fas `adsk-fusion-service` module.
//
// The package appears to ship only type declarations (.d.ts) for
// `adsk-fusion-service`. The top-level `index.js` imports this module at
// runtime, but no corresponding .js file was present which caused
// ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND. This shim provides a harmless placeholder export
// so code that imports `@adsk/fas` can run (or be further instrumented
// with real functionality if needed).

// Export a named `adsk` object. Populate with minimal stubs if your
// TypeScript expects particular runtime members.
export const adsk = {
  // Example stub: uncomment/add members your code needs
  // fusion: { /* ... */ },
};

export default { adsk };
